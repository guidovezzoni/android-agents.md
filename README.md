# Android AGENTS.md
AGENTS.md and guidelines for Android native projects

## Desciption
This repository collects guidelines for guiding agents in their code generation and day-to-day operations with Android code. I will be updating these guidelines while I work with them.

The idea is to begin from the AGENTS.md [agents.md](https://agents.md), which appears to becoming a standard. Other configurations will try to refer to this.
Its first section provides instructions on how and when to read other set of instructions, depending on which type of code the agent is reading, for instance `guidelines-android.md`.
