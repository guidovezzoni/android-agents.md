AGENTS.MD and guidelines for Android native projects

This repository collects guidelines for guiding agents in their code generation and day-to-day operations with Android code. I will be updating these guidelines while I work with them.

**Disclaimer 1**: Some of these guidelines might not work as expected or not work at all, depending on tooling and other factors. Use at your own risk.

**Disclaimer 2**: Some of these guidelines might be debatable, or you mightnot like them, feel free to change them or to let me know your suggestion.
