# AGENTS.md

This file contains guidelines and commands for agentic coding agents working in this repository.

## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis. They're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed
- If a file reference cannot be found, always notify the user.

## Development Guidelines
